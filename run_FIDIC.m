function run_FIDIC(varargin)
%RUN_FIDIC   Run fast iterative digital image correlation (FIDIC).

% This file calls the DIC analysis and runs it for the images in the
% current working directory. Data is saved in mat format in the current
% working directory. 
% 
% REQUIRED INPUTS
% fname_ref:        reference image
%                   Set to empty array [] if there is no separate
%                   reference image
% fname_multipage:  multipage (or single) tif containing current image(s)
% savename:         name to save data
% w0:               target subset size (pix)
% d0:               subset spacing (pix)
% inc:              set to 0 for cumulative; 1 for incremental comparison
% OPTIONAL INPUT
% image_seq:        Vector conataining sequence of images to correlate. If
%                   this is left blank, correlation will occur for all
%                   images.
% 
%                   If no reference image is given, minimum value of im_seq
%                   should be 2, corresponding to the 2nd image in the
%                   multipage stack.
% 
%                   Important note for incremental correlation: The 
%                   sequence indentified by image_seq are the only images
%                   used in the correlation. This means that the
%                   incremental comparison is between the images and in the 
%                   order specified by image_seq.
